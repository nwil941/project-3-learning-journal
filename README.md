# project-3-learning-journal

In this project I found it really exciting to start to see where our app was heading. I really enjoyed doing the drawings for the paper prototypeing.
We were forced to compromise ideas as ech group member visioned the app differently. We worked well to get the idea to try and fit everybodys ideas into one.
For the next project we definattly need to start earlier to allow more time.
